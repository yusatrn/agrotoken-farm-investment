echo "======================================="

echo ""
echo "📊 1. Current Fix Status:"
echo "   ✅ Balance display fixes applied"
echo "   ✅ Amount conversion fixes applied"  
echo "   ✅ Whitelist function fixed for simple contract"
echo "   ❓ Transfer functionality - TESTING NOW"

echo "🔧 3. Transfer Function Analysis:"
echo "   Contract Function: transfer(from: Address, to: Address, amount: i128)"
echo "   - Uses from.require_auth() for authentication"
echo "   - Checks balance before transfer"
echo "   - Updates balances directly"
echo "   - No whitelist validation in contract"

echo ""
echo "📋 4. Frontend Transfer Logic:"
echo "   1. Validates recipient address format"
echo "   2. Checks isWhitelisted() for both addresses (should return true)"
echo "   3. Checks sender balance"
echo "   4. Converts amount using toContractAmount() (fixed to use raw numbers)"
echo "   5. Calls contract transfer function"

echo ""
echo "🔍 5. Potential Issues:"
echo "   a) Contract auth failure (wrong signer)"
echo "   b) RPC connection issues" 
echo "   c) Transaction timeout"
echo "   d) Amount conversion error"
echo "   e) Contract not properly deployed"

echo ""
echo "🧪 6. Manual Testing Steps:"
echo "   1. Open http://localhost:3000/transfer"
echo "   2. Connect Freighter wallet"
echo "   3. Enter recipient address: GCQMVFGAABCTX4TFA65BQTJJ5ZRSPN5ROU5R2L2ZDGVHZ4E7QSG6XXTF"
echo "   4. Enter amount: 10"
echo "   5. Click Transfer"
echo "   6. Check browser console for errors"

echo ""
echo "📋 7. Expected Transfer Flow:"
echo "   a) Frontend validates inputs ✅"
echo "   b) Calls toContractAmount(10) → '10' ✅"
echo "   c) Calls isWhitelisted() → true ✅"
echo "   d) Calls contract.transfer(from, to, '10')"
echo "   e) Contract requires from.require_auth()"
echo "   f) Freighter signs transaction"
echo "   g) Transaction submitted to network"

echo ""
echo "🔧 8. Key Files Status:"
echo "   - lib/stellar.ts: Amount conversion functions fixed ✅"
echo "   - lib/contract.ts: isWhitelisted() returns true for valid addresses ✅"
echo "   - stores/contract.ts: Transfer function calls contract client ✅"
echo "   - src/lib.rs: Simple transfer function with auth ✅"

echo ""
echo "🎯 9. Next Steps if Transfer Still Fails:"
echo "   a) Check exact error message in browser console"
echo "   b) Verify contract deployment on testnet"
echo "   c) Test with Stellar CLI direct contract call"
echo "   d) Check Freighter wallet connection"
echo "   e) Verify RPC endpoint health"

echo "✅ READY FOR TRANSFER TESTING"

echo "Please test transfer functionality at: http://localhost:3000/transfer"
echo "Report any 'UnreachableCodeReached' or other errors found."
