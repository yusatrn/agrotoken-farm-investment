# Debug Cleanup Summary

## ✅ Completed Debug Cleanup

### 1. Menu Debug Items Removed (Header.tsx)
**Removed the following debug menu items:**
- 🔧 Payment Debug (`/payment-debug`)
- 🔬 Diagnostics (`/diagnostics`) 
- 🎯 Address Test (`/address-test`)
- 🧪 Payment Validation (`/payment-validation`)
- 🚀 Production Test (`/production-test`)
- 📊 Platform Status (`/platform-status`)
- Debug (`/debug`)

**Kept essential menu items:**
- Dashboard
- Investment
- Agricultural Marketplace  
- List Your Farm
- Share Transfer

### 2. Console.log Debug Statements Removed

**From `app/page.tsx`:**
- Removed: `console.log('🔍 Fetching user data for address:', address);`
- Removed: Debug state logging with dashboard state details

**From `app/invest/page.tsx`:**
- Removed: `console.log('🚀 Investment button clicked!', ...)`
- Removed: `console.log('💰 Starting payment processing...')`
- Removed: `console.log('💳 Payment result:', result)`
- Removed: `console.log('✅ Investment successful:', result)`
- Removed: `console.warn` statements for validation failures

**Kept essential error logging:**
- `console.error` statements for actual errors (polling, portfolio loading, investment failures)
- These are important for debugging real issues in production

### 3. Clean Menu Structure
The navigation menu now only shows production-ready features:
```
├── Dashboard (/)
├── Investment (/invest)  
├── Agricultural Marketplace (/marketplace)
├── List Your Farm (/tokenize)
└── Share Transfer (/transfer)
```

### 4. Production Ready
- No debug console spam in browser console
- Clean, professional navigation menu
- Only essential error logging remains for troubleshooting
- All balance display fixes remain intact

## 🔍 Verification
1. Menu shows only 5 clean navigation items
2. No debug console.log output during normal operations
3. Error console.error logging still works for actual issues
4. Balance displays work correctly (316 AGRO = $316)

## 📝 Notes
- Debug routes `/debug`, `/payment-debug`, etc. may still exist as pages but are no longer accessible via menu
- Consider removing those page files entirely if they're not needed
- Error logging (`console.error`) was intentionally kept for production debugging
